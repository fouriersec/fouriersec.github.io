I'm currently an 18 year old student from London.  
I have been exploring Cyber Security from about 2020 and specifically Offensive Security from 2021.  
This site was created as a way to document my improvement in Offensive Security and general knowledge of Cyber Security. Here, you'll find numerous CTFs (especially from HackTheBox) that I've completed and hopefully learn from my thought process.
